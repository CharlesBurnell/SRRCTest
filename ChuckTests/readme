This is a test area where I have the following
Ubuntu 16.04
ROS 1.12.0
freenect 1:0.5.3-1
OpenCV 2.4.3

Goals with this are to get code that compiles and runs in C++
With cooresponding python code.

In the process of a major update overhall. changing it so that
you don't go down a function rabbit hole.
Going to redo all of it so that the code doesn't go into
more than one function call.
